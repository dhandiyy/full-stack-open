# Full Stack Open Learning Project

This repository contains the code and exercises completed as part of the **Full Stack Open** course provided by the University of Helsinki. The course focuses on modern web development techniques using JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and GraphQL.

## Project Overview

This project is a hands-on learning exercise where I follow the instructions and complete the exercises provided in the Full Stack Open course. The course covers both frontend and backend development, including topics such as:

- **React.js:** Creating interactive UIs and managing state with hooks and context.
- **Node.js & Express:** Building robust server-side applications.
- **MongoDB:** Handling data storage and retrieval with a NoSQL database.
- **REST & GraphQL APIs:** Designing and implementing APIs.
- **Testing:** Writing unit tests and integration tests to ensure code reliability.

## Course Sections Covered

The repository is structured according to the different sections of the course:

1. **Part 0: Fundamentals of Web Apps**
2. **Part 1: Introduction to React**
3. **Part 2: Communicating with Server**
4. **Part 3 (include part 4): Programming a Server with Node.js, Express, Testing Express Servers and User Administration**
